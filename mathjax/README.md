Check out a copy of the
[nodejs](https://github.com/dpvc/MathJax/tree/nodejs) branch of
MathJax and store it here.  E.g., from the top-level Mathjax-node
directory

       git clone https://github.com/dpvc/MathJax mathjax
       cd mathjax
       git checkout nodejs

This version has some modifications needed by the MathJax-node API.
These will be merged into the core MathJax code after the v2.4
release.
